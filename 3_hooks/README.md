# Hooks #

1. Examine the component in the file `pages/usestate`. Use state to define the color of the button. Add an event that will change the button color after clicking.
2. In the file, there is a set of questions (`pages/useeffect`). Reset the error information every time the user moves to the next question.
3. In the file `pages/useref`, there is a small component. Add animation to the red div. Move it down (300px) and to the right (300px). Change its color to blue. Use the animate function from jQuery (https://api.jquery.com/animate/).
4. In the file `pages/usememo`, you will find a component with two functionalities: changing the color and calculating the factorial. Make sure the factorial is calculated only when necessary.
5. Examine the component in `pages/callback`. Consider why the callback is triggered every second and try to prevent it.
6. Check the code in `pages/usereducer`. Get rid of the errors in the equation.
7. In the file `pages/forwardref`, use a reference in the parent to focus the input in the child component.
8. In the file `usedeferredvalue.tsx`, optimize the script using the useDeferredValue hook. Try using the useTransition hook as well.
