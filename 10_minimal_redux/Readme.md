# Bank simulation

Let's play a bank simulation. Customers can take loans and make deposits. Let's assume that the interest rate on deposits is 2% every 5 seconds, and the interest rate on loans is 5% every 5 seconds.

1. Create reducers for the bank and the customer.
2. Assume that the customer has one loan and can increase it. The same goes for deposits.
3. Calculate everything. The account balance of bank customers must be updated every 5 seconds.
4. Calculate the overall balance of the bank.
