# Football manager

Imagine that you are the manager of the Polish national team.

1. Start json-server using the command `json-server --watch ./db.json --port 3004`
2. Load the list of players for the Polish national team on the homepage. Use React-Query.
3. Create routing for the application, prepare pages for each player, a "manager" page, and the homepage.
4. On the "manager" page, create a form for adding new players and a list of current players with the ability to delete them.
5. Use prefetching mechanism to fetch data for individual subpages.
6. Add the option to edit content on the individual player pages - you can use the `contentEditable` attribute instead of traditional inputs.
